# Context

Acme Corp routinely gets high marks from its employees for its culture. There are few, if any, conflicts on serious issues. Survey results show more than 90% of the team answering "Strongly Agree" to the question "Are you happy at Acme Corp?". 

Michael[^1] joined Acme six months ago to manage a senior backoffice engineering team. It was a well-regarded team whose manager had left the company on good terms. With her understanding of employees' career objectives, willingness to advocate for them with senior leaders and other teams, and eagerness to give credit to her team members, Michael always scored extremely highly on 360 surveys. Many held strong opinions on technical issues given their experience, but the team maintained a collegial environment.

Very soon after joining, Michael took on a very challenging project to migrate backoffice operations to a new set of payment providers. Several weeks in, the team was not making a lot of progress. PeopleOps talked to the team and found that while the team was concerned about the lack of progress, morale[^2] seemed to be high. The fact that the team was working hard to overcome project hurdles suggested that the team remained highly motivated.


# Challenge

Why was a senior, hard-working team with high morale falling behind on its key project? How can we rescue the project?


# Discussion Prompts

- What are some pros/cons of adding engineers to the team? Or exchanging engineers with some other teams?
- What are some possible explanations for low productivity despite high morale?
- What are some possible explanations for low productivity despite high effort?
- How might the backoffice team's prior performance play into the assessment or analysis?
- Are there ways in which strong 360 feedback could be misleading?
- In what ways can lack of conflict be a bad thing?
