# Context
Acme Corp is doing well! The startup builds decarbonization technology and has created the associated Carboni cryptocurrency to incentivize carbon capture. The Banks team, with Sisko as their engineering manager, builds out the intricate connections from central bank infrastructures to CarboniChain. Because there are no standards for such work, each integration is bespoke and needs a high level of ongoing maintenance. A team of 6, with Sisko doubling as the lead engineer, built the initial connections with the central banks of New Zealand, Japan and Barbados. The huge success of those projects led to immediate support for the Banks team to begin engagements with larger central banks and their more complex integrations.

The team has been given budget to grow to 15 to facilate more parallel new integrations and to maintain the existing ones.

# Challenge
In a few days, Sisko must present an annual plan that includes the team growth. He is being given wide latitude in shaping the growth. Because he's been so focused on building the first few integrations, Sisko has never thought about how his role might change with growth. What are some common growth patterns and how do each of them impact his role?

# Discussion Prompts
- What do we know about the situation? What are some things we might want to know that aren't mentioned?
- What are some growth patterns that you've seen? Did they work? Were they very particular to the environment or can they be copied?
- What are some other growth patterns to be considered?
- How do each of those growth patterns affect Sisko's role? Can we find some way to eliminate some options because they don't work for Sisko?
- What are some skills that Sisko may need to develop or use as the team grows? Are there any inflection points in that growth that he should be aware of?
- What kind of support should he ask for from Acme Corp's leadership to be succesful?
