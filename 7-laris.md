# Context

Laris[^1] is in a bit of hot water! Here's what happened.

Agnes has been with Acme Corp. forever (or so it feels). After a 2-year stint in the protocol group before they released v1, where the biggest challenges dried up once they had built the foundations, she hopped around teams. Senior leadership at the company saw that Agnes had the knowledge and experience to help many teams with their thorniest challenges and moved her around as and when teams faced difficult issues. Early on in her role as a roving lead engineer, she worked with Elnor, an engineer on the payments team, scale their system 100x to keep up with rapid demand. A few months later, she was on the econometrics team with Jack when they created their sophisticated pricing and inflation models. Fast forward two years and Acme is running up against a wall with the futuristic Starfleet project. Starfleet was started by Elnor and Jack together with a small team of less senior engineers and has been in development for several months. Just recently, Jack referred a former colleague of his, Laris, to be the engineering manager for Starfleet. 

If successful, Starfleet could easily establish an almost insurmountable lead against the competition. Building such a strong differentiator was obviously going to be a risky project but with growth starting to flatten out in other areas, and with few other substantial ideas, Acme was starting to get desperate to see Starfleet shipped. As had been done quite a few times, leadership moved Agnes into the Starfleet team to help.

After taking a couple of weeks to gain her bearings, Agnes recommended a more modular approach to the project and asked to create a new sub-team to work on one of the modules. Leadership eagerly agreed and created a budget for hiring more engineers. Agnes immediately started the hunt for a lead engineer. Now, eight weeks and five candidates into the effort, she still hasn't filled the lead role, never mind the rest of the team. Even though her screening is very rigorous, she hasn't gotten unanimous approval from the rest of the committee, including Elnor and Jack as the senior members of the team.

# Challenge

How can Laris figure out what might be going on and help Starfleet make progress? Laris is still new. Where should she dig?

# Discussion Prompts

1. Make sure to consider issues along different axes: people issues, technical issues, and process issues.
2. There are at least five stakeholders mentioned here. How might each of them be contributing to the problem? How might they contribute to a solution?
   1. Laris
   2. Jack
   3. Elnor
   4. Agnes
   5. Leadership
4. Tease apart each decision. What are the tradeoffs inherent in the decision?
5. How have decisions been made? What are the tradeoffs in the decision-making process?
6. What are some factors that cause major disagreements in candidate assessment?
