# Context
Note: read the [Malcolm](malcolm.md) case study first.

Acme Corp is back on track and has now gained a good foothold with utilities, expanding on their initial traction with central banks. 

With some effort and with a bit of help from Trip, Hoshi and the Apex team were able to find and fix the issues with Gorilla that made the Flash rollout such a disaster. 

Acme Corp's recent issues with major incidents at customers after building Flash made everyone particularly sensitive to product issues. 

- The Flash cloud service has a few small incidents.
- Then after some seemingly routine changes, everything goes down for several hours. After a round of oncall escalation, Trip and Hoshi end up on the incident and narrow down the problem to a small piece of glue code that the Apex team modified to accommodate changes in a library dependency.
- Trip has had enough and talks to Malcolm about getting rid of Apex or Hoshi or at least sidelining them somehow.

# Challenge
- What do? How to balance blame-free cultures and accountability? How to assign the fault to the individual, the team lead, the team collectively, the engineering organization, or even the company? Too strong a reaction will drive defensive behavior in the future. Too weak a response could create a sense of no accountability.
