# Context
Acme Corp is doing well! The startup builds decarbonization technology and has created the associated Carboni cryptocurrency to incentivize carbon capture. The Carboni team, led by their manager Sulu, does highly specialized work at the intersection of cryptocurrency, economics, and clean tech. The team has produced high quality work so far and has been able to manage their technical debt so that they are pretty effective in focusing on innovation. However, the team has several hard commitments including some features needed to hit revenue targets to support an upcoming IPO.

Now a big new opportunity has opened with the US and other major governments wanting to make Acme Corp part of a big new initiative. It will hugely boost the value of Carboni in Acme Corp’s treasury, among other benefits. Sulu has opened up a req to add to the team’s capacity to take on this new work, which needs to be delivered within nine months.

Sulu expects that a knowledgeable engineer could complete the changes needed to support this new initiative in three months. An otherwise strong engineer lacking the domain experience would need at least another three months of training to build the expertise.

# Challenge
Three months have elapsed since the req was opened, and we are now exactly six months from the deadline to complete the work. Sulu has yet to find the right candidate. What should Sulu do? 

It seems like Sulu’s options are:
- Hire the next strong engineer he can find (which may itself take some time) and move as fast as possible with the training.
- Ramp up efforts to find an engineer with the necessary specialized skills within the next three months.

# Discussion Prompts
- Should Sulu hire the next decent engineer he can find and just move as fast as possible with the training?
- Should Sulu ramp up hiring efforts somehow? How?
- Is there something Sulu should have been doing during those first three months?
- What should Sulu be communicating up the management chain?
- How do other projects at Acme Corp influence this? How do other projects within the Carboni team influence this?
