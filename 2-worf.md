# Context
Acme Corp is doing well! The startup builds decarbonization technology and has created the associated Carboni cryptocurrency to incentivize carbon capture. The Acme Apps team, led by their manager Worf, builds SDKs to accelerate the efforts of banks and governmental agencies to join the Carboni ecosystem. The team has grown organically through efforts to scale and replicate one-off integration efforts. The team of six engineers has a healthy mix of application development experts, blockchain enthusiasts, and policy experts, so they are able to quickly understand and implement any requirements. As a small team, every engineer carries a part of the load of talking directly with customers to understand the nitty-gritty of each integration project. The nature of this work has attracted a certain profile to the team: relatively senior, broadly knowledegable, independent, and intrinsically motivated.

Worf has just returned from a three month-long sabbatical. During his time off, Troi, the first engineer to join the Acme Apps team when Worf decided to create it, has been acting manager. She has thrived in the role, using all the context she has gained over time, and all the relationships she has built helping onboard every single team member who joined after her. Barring minor gaps in a couple of areas, the team has been doing very well despite Worf's absence.

# Challenge
In their first meeting after Worf's return, Troi tells him how much she enjoyed the role. She likes the individuals on the team, likes the work, and likes the company. She would like to be an engineering manager and to stay with the Acme Apps team or at least Acme Corp, given how much the company values and encourages internal mobility and growth.

Troi has earned the right to be supported in her professional development, but how many managers does a team of six need? Worf needs to find a way to support Troi's career development and aspirations to be an engineering manager while maintaining the team's efficiency and effectiveness.

# Discussion Prompts
- How does the composition of the Acme Apps team influence your thinking?
- Speculate on what exactly Troi did and achieved during her test run as manager. What was the environment like during that time? How does that influence your thinking?
- What could Worf have done earlier that might now help him?
- What else do you want to know about Troi's motivations in pursuing this role? About her motivations in general?
- What do you want to know about how team members interacted with Troi? Or how Worf's peer managers interacted with Troi?
- What if the Acme Apps team is likely to grow, what if the team isn't? What if the company is likely to grow, what if it isn't?
- Might Troi's prior experience be relevant? How so?
- What would most help Worf: demonstrating empathy, active listening, negotiation, or decision-making skills?
