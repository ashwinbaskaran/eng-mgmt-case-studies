# Context
Acme Corp has run up an impressive series of wins on the strength of its team, with its rare combination of skills across economics, cryptocurrencies, and software engineering. One team that has been particularly impactful of late is the BetaTech team, with Kathryn as its manager, which created a framework to deliver new central bank integrations at 10x the speed. Now a critical issue has surfaced: in a recent anonymous company survey, a few engineers on Kathryn's team have indicated that they will consider leaving Acme Corp within the next year.

Kathryn immediately recognizes the need to respond to the survey results. Her objective is clearly to put together a solid retention plan, but to achieve that she first needs an understanding of the reasons underlying the survey results.

# Challenge
How might Kathryn develop a solid understanding of the factors behind the survey results, given that the survey is anonymous?
The challenges Kathryn faces include:
- Presenting the survey results to the team without escalating concerns or creating a defensive environment.
- Encouraging candid, productive discussions to uncover the underlying reasons behind the dissatisfaction.
- Collaboratively devising and implementing a plan that addresses the issues while aligning with Acme's overall strategies and values.

# Discussion Prompts
- In the first place, why is it challenging?
- What other questions were in the survey and how might they provide some basis to define next steps?
- Should Kathryn share the survey results with the team?
- How should Kathryn engage with the team - one on one or as a team? Maybe one on one for certain discussions and as a team for others?
- How might Kathryn engage team members in the analysis? Should she?
- What might Kathryn need to have been doing **before** the survey in order to make her effective in responding now?
- How can the company understand whether Kathryn's efforts are working and, if not, what changes might help? What if Kathryn's effort fail?
- Are there things that could help turn this potential crisis into a learning and strengthening experience?
