Acme Corp, the trailblazer in decarbonization technology and the force behind the revolutionary Carboni cryptocurrency, thrives on its innovative and dynamic workforce. However, following a recent company-wide employee survey, a critical issue has surfaced. Key members of the BetaTech team, responsible for several strategic projects, have indicated they may consider leaving Acme within the next year.

Tackling this sensitive issue is Kathryn, the manager of BetaTech. She recognizes the need to delve into the underlying causes of dissatisfaction and act quickly to retain this vital talent. This complex situation demands not only a clear understanding of the concerns but also the skill to engage the team in an open, constructive conversation, leading to a solid retention plan.

# Challenge
The challenges Kathryn faces includes:
- Presenting the survey results to the team without escalating concerns or creating a defensive environment.
- Encouraging candid, productive discussions to uncover the underlying reasons behind the dissatisfaction.
- Collaboratively devising and implementing a plan that addresses the issues while aligning with Acme's overall strategies and values.
