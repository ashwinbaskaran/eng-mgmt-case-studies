# Context
Acme Corp’s Helios engineering team, led by their manager Kira, is at the center of a highly visible initiative with significant external and internal implications. The team owns the links to the government treasuries backing Acme's Carboni cryptocurrency, often requiring deep technical expertise and consequently a long ramp-up period for new engineers. Helios’ current project involves developing and deploying an audit platform known as Aurora, which enables Acme Corp to meet compliance requirements set by various regulatory agencies.

The stakes are high. Acme’s Head of Government Relations, Dax, has been making commitments to regulatory agencies on when Acme would be ready to demonstrate compliance with regulations. However, Helios has missed several key deadlines, leading to escalating concerns among stakeholders.

The challenges Helios faces are complex. Much of the work involves integrating new tools and managing dependencies that were not fully understood when commitments were made. While the team is highly motivated and deeply committed to the project, their intense workload has brought them to the brink of burnout. Despite the team’s progress, stakeholder trust has eroded, leaving Kira struggling to rebuild credibility with Dax and Riker, the Director of Engineering for Helios.

To address missed deadlines, Kira has tried adding engineers to the team. However, the steep ramp-up time for new members has delayed the impact of this decision. Dax and other stakeholders remain skeptical and have escalated their concerns directly to Riker. Stakeholders worry that relaxing pressure on Helios could lead to further delays, yet their current lack of trust in the team limits transparency and collaboration.

The potential consequences of failure are not entirely clear but could be severe, ranging from reputational damage and regulatory penalties to loss of key partnerships. Riker must find a way to steer the project back on track while managing stakeholder expectations and supporting Kira and the Helios team.

# Challenge
How can Kira and Riker rebuild trust with stakeholders and support the Helios team in meeting its commitments without exacerbating burnout or risking further delays?

# Discussion Prompts
1. What are the key factors contributing to the team’s struggles, and how might Kira and Riker address them effectively?
2. How can Riker help navigate stakeholder trust issues with Dax while ensuring the team has the space and support needed to succeed?
3. What are the trade-offs of continuing to add engineers versus focusing on optimizing the current team’s workflow?
4. How might Kira and Riker engage Dax and other stakeholders to manage expectations without framing the project as a pass/fail scenario? What could be done to present progress along a spectrum of outcomes?
5. What actions should Riker and Kira prioritize to ensure long-term sustainability for Helios while addressing the immediate crisis?
