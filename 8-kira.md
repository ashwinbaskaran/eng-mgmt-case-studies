# Context
Acme Corp’s Helios engineering team, led by their manager Riker, is at the center of a highly visible initiative with significant external and internal implications. The team owns the links to the government treasuries backing Acme's Carboni cryptocurrency, often requiring deep technical expertise and consequently a long ramp-up period for new engineers. Helios is currently building Aurora, an audit platform which enables Acme Corp to meet compliance requirements set by regulatory agencies.

The stakes are high. Dax, Acme’s Head of Government Relations, has been making commitments to regulatory agencies on when Acme would be ready to demonstrate compliance with regulations. However, Helios has missed several key deadlines, leading to escalating concerns among stakeholders.

The challenges Helios faces are complex. Much of the work involves integrating new tools and managing dependencies that were not fully understood when commitments were made. While the team is highly motivated and deeply committed to the project, their intense workload has brought them to the brink of burnout. Despite the team’s progress, Dax has escalated to the executive team and flagged Aurora as a problem project. The executive team has asked Kira, the Director of Engineering for Helios, to "just fix it".

Kira has tried adding engineers to the team. However, the steep ramp-up time for new members has delayed any positive impact. Kira has also spent time explaining the details to Dax. However, Dax feels relaxing pressure on Helios could lead to further delays, so he continues to escalate this to executives.

The potential consequences of failure are not entirely clear but could be severe, ranging from reputational damage and regulatory penalties to loss of key partnerships. Riker must find a way to steer the project back on track while managing stakeholder expectations and supporting Kira and the Helios team.
