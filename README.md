# Engineering Management Case Studies
This repo contains short case studies to prompt discussion, reflection, and learning about engineering management. The case studies are intentionally short, vague on specifics, and open to a variety of interpretations, so that they facilitate open-ended discussions that enourage thinking about the full space of potential solutions rather than anchor in on "correct" answers.

# Sequence
While the case studies could be used in any order, going in the following order may be helpful to build more context and eventually to richer interpretations and analyses.
1. Sulu
2. Worf
3. Sisko
4. Kathryn
5. Malcolm (coming soon)
