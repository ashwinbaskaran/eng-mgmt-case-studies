# Engineering Management Case Studies
This repo contains short case studies to prompt discussion, reflection, and learning about engineering management. The case studies are intentionally short, vague on specifics, and open to a variety of interpretations, so that they facilitate open-ended discussions that enourage thinking about the full space of potential solutions rather than narrow "correct" answers.

# Context
All case studies here use the fictional Acme Corp as their setting. Acme Corp is a high-growth, innovation-driven startup operating at the forefront of clean tech, blockchain, and cryptocurrency. It thrives on a culture of autonomy and transparency, with highly skilled teams delivering impactful, high-quality work. However, its rapid growth and ambitious goals create challenges in scalability, talent retention, leadership development, and other areas. This requires thoughtful systems and processes to sustain long-term success.

# Sequence
While the case studies could be used in any order, going in the following order may be helpful to build more context and eventually to richer interpretations and analyses.
